# Datamatrix
IEC16022 Bar code generation library and command line

Needs a makefile sorting, uses https://github.com/revk/Reedsol and https://github.com/revk/Image


This allows you to make Datamatrix (aka IEC16022) 2D bar codes.

The library creates a bit pattern.

The command line creates an image (png or gif) or text or postscript, etc.
